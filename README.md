## Programming for DA project
This is the assignment for the module *Programming for Data Analysis* where I synthetise a data set from a real-world phenomenon. My choice was to simulate a health study were a 400-people sample was taken in order to study the relationship between cardiovascular disease (heart attack) and its risk factors.

In this repository there is a Jupiter notebook (.ipynb) which represents the core of my project. I recommend to download the full repository to your local machine, open your command line, lead it to the repo folder and then execute the command `jupyter notebook` so that you can run it through your browser. The main libraries used are:

- numpy 
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pandas

so make sure you have the latest versions of them on your machine. Also see below the technical specifications.

On the other hand note that I added the python magic command `%matplotlib inline` to make sure the plots are displayed properly.

### Technical specifications
The code within this project follows the Python version 3.6.4. In order to guarantee a normal code execution, the easiest way is to have Anaconda installed on your machine, you can download it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
